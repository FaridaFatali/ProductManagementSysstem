* We have 3 kinds of products: Food, Cloth and Consultancy. For Food and Clothes we have location and price,
* but for Consultancy we have only price, not location. We also have gifts for Food and Cloth products.
* We also sell our old items that they are not products, we sell them from our depot, they have location and price.
